        <h2>Reading Novels, Manga, and Manhwa</h2>
        <p>Reading is one of my favorite hobbies. It allows me to escape into different realms, whether it's a fantastical world filled with supernatural powers or an adventurous quest. <br> I don’t have a specific type when I read as long as it is fantasy where there is a supernatural power involved. I said I don't have any specific type when I am reading but it all depends on what I am reading. Like if i am reading novels i prefer them to be more about mysteries here they go on an adventure to find a treasure exploring dungeons and something like that and when i am reading manga and manhwa i like it when there is a fighting like in murim realm where they fight with sword and fists like in the old days

        <h2>Cooking</h2>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3186649/pexels-photo-3186649.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=627&fit=crop&w=1200" alt="" width="100">
        <p>Cooking is one of my favorite things to do, especially when I'm home alone. I find it to be a creative outlet where I experiment with different ingredients, like eggs, to make versatile meals. <br> I watch movies about people cooking and different styles with the same ingredients so I can tell you that cooking allows you to be creative with ingredients, flavors, and presentations. You can experiment with new recipes, invent your own, or modify existing ones to suit your taste. The kitchen becomes your personal canvas. One of the food i love cooking is egg as it can be used with many types of food like bread, meat, rice potatoes and many others

        <p>i started learning to cook by the age of 14 when my mother showed me how to do the chicken ofcouse i wasn't able to do that and my mom was jocking and she only showed me how to do it so that i don't leave the house but it was fun. <br>when i am cooking there is a personal satisfaction when i'm done. <br> Preparing a meal from scratch can bring a sense of pride and accomplishment, especially when you see others enjoying what you’ve made <br>just a remainder cooking is my hoddy but the one i make are graded c-. they aren't good </p>

        <h2>Movies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy a wide variety of movies, from action films to anime and classic franchises like Star Wars. Movies offer a great escape and provide a way to explore different worlds and characters.</p>
        <p>Movies come in many ways. There are action movies, there are franchise movies, there are series movies, there are animation and many more. I enjoy many of them. Frankly, I don’t think there is anyone that doesn't like them. I grew up watching movies that are still being released like the avengers, anime like the one piece. Movies that don't get old like the star wars with the sith and jedi knights</p>
        <p>one of my favorite movies of all time is One Piece <br><img src="https://www.pixelstalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/One-Piece-Wallpaper-HD-Dekstop-Background.jpg" alt="" width="150"> </p>
